# JustGiving's Xamarin Bindings

We have created 4 Xamarin.iOS Bindings for use in JustGiving's newly launched iPhone app, and are making them available for others to use:

- KissMetrics (reasonably well tested)
- Zendesk (reasonably well tested)
- Adjust (reasonably well tested)
- Optimizely (in testing)
- ExactTarget (in testing)
- Mixpanel (well tested - also see blogpost for how to use [Tweaks](http://tech.justgiving.com/2016/06/08/integrating-mixpanel-analytics-into-your-xamarin-ios-app/))

We've also created Xamarin.Android bindings:
- KissMetrics (partially tested)

While these have worked well for our app, they are provided "as-is" and pull requests for any bugs are gratefully received.

Just add one or more binding projects to your solution, and then add a reference to that binding project from your iOS project.
