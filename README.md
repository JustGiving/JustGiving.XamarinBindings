# JustGiving and ScoreBigs's Xamarin Bindings

This repository is a fork of JustGiving's public Xamarin Bindings project. In addition to the bindings originally found there, ScoreBig has updated the repository with bug fixes, test suites, and sample apps for Optimizely and Kissmetrics. Furthermore, we've added 2 new projects:

- ThreatMetrix TrustDefender Mobile iOS (in testing)
- Gigya iOS (in testing) - forked from: https://github.com/AudioAddict/gigya-sdk-xamarin

While these have worked well for our app, they are provided "as-is" and pull requests for any bugs are gratefully received.

Just add one or more binding projects to your solution, and then add a reference to that binding project from your iOS project.
